# WallpaperApp
Hi!

I am building this app as a project for my AP CS A class, and the goal of this app is to provide a seamless way of changing wallpapers.

My application currently is just a welcome screen, but it will eventually be able to access the user's gallery and allow them to choose wallpapers they would like to set.
It will also be able to save older wallpapers, and import wallpapers from the web using a URL.

## Technologies Used:
Java

Android Studio

Plan to implement Firebase

## How to Install:
Currently, you just have to pull or clone the project into your Android Studio and run it on an emulator.
